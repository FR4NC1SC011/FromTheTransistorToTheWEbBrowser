# From The Transistor To The Web Browser
Inspired by George Hotz -> [geohot/fromthetransistor](https://github.com/geohot/fromthetransistor).

# What did we learn from this?

* A program is just big array bytes
* A CPU is just a lot of transistors
* Writing a CPU emulator and a interpreter is time consuming
* ASM is not that difficult
* Writing a TCP stack is hard

# TODO 07/2021
* Build a filesystem. Maybe FAT?
* Build user space programs.(cat, ls, rm, etc.)
